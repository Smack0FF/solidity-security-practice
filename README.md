# Solidity Security Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing common smart contract vulnerabilities and preparing for Web3 Security Engineer roles.

Structure:
`/reentrancy` – classic withdrawal attack
`/delegatecall` – code execution hijack
`/txorigin` – phishing auth flaw
`/integer-overflow` – arithmetic exploits

Each folder will include:
- A vulnerable smart contract
- An explanation / write-up
- A test or exploit

Goal: Build hands-on experience for security auditing and interviews.
